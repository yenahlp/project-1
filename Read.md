A Reminder of AI Usage
I will always encourage the use of AI to help you with your coursework, but
to be wise and accountable in its use. For each instance that AI is used, you
must disclose it in the comments of your code with a date stamp and the
prompt you provided the AI with. In general, you may use AI to help you
with the design of your website, but the content must be original and
created by you.
Good luck and HAVE FUN with this project!
